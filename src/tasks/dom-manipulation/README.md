# DOM Manipulation

This is an application with two examples: a counter and a timer.
Both only use the DOM API to add/remove elements to/from an HTML document.

Both the modules (`counter.js` and `timer.js`) export a `render` function which accepts an HTML node as an argument that can act as the container element for the counter/timer.
